"Just opened Greenies Joint Care (individually sealed) in December 2011 and found small worm crawling all over it.  Next one looked fine, but really supposed to trust these now?"
This product rocks :) My mom was very happy w/the product it was excatly as described we loved seeing all the candy and eating it all :)
"The product was fine, but the cost of shipping was more than the cost<br />of the tea.  Won't make that mistake again."
"I love this soup. It's great as part of a meal or as a nutritious and satisifying low-in-calorie snack. For a light lunch, I stir in some shreeded cheese."
"Getting ready to order again. These are great because they compost very quickly. BUT, some of the bags have tears in the bottom, so remember to always carry extra so you have emergency 'back-up' bags!  A bit costly but, again, better for the environment."
"These were delicious, but not wrapped as well as I think they should be.  They kind of melted out of their wrapping."
"I will never again even CONSIDER a dog food with corn, wheat or soy in it. Grain has no place in a dog's diet!"
"If you need something to take with you to keep your blood sugar up, this high-fiber, high-protein snack is just the thing."
My husband puts this on everything. It is very expensive to buy in the grocery store and it comes in a small bottle. This bottle is huge. It is a great buy. There is enough to bottle and give away to others.
"This is a movie the whole family can watch together.  It has great comedy, a little sacary and lots of laughs."
I bought this item in hopes of keeping some pests away. i had read that pests hate the smell of peppermint oil. It is working. I am very pleased. thanks so much.
"This tea is so smooth, better than Lipton or any other iced tea product.  In fact the people I work with have tasted the tea and have asked where they can get it. Shame you can't find it in Sacramento, California."
I purchased this tea because I was told that it helps with excess gas but this tea has made worsen my gas problem. I am very disappointed with the purchase
Hands down the best cocoa I've had in a long time.  Kept searching for a decent replacement since my stores stopped carrying this.  The only thing that comes close (haven't done a side-by-side taste test) is Hershey's Dutch Hot Chocolate cocoa mix.
so far so good the packaging was awesome the tree looks healthy. i can only hope that i have better luck than the others that left reviews lol....
I searched for K-Cups and this product was listed. It is not for a K-Cup Keurig brewer. Amazon needs to remove this product from the K-Cup category.
I always loved this cereal when I was young. I still love it and I am so glad I found it!
I liked this product. I eat popcorn all the time and this brand is my favorite. Act II is a class act!
"I would give this one a 5 star, but no one seems to be able to make a natural sweet tea flavor. Other than that it is quite good!"
"I don't think this tastes more than OK when you mix it with water to a paste, as the package suggests. But it is good for baking, in my oatmeal porridge and with cottage cheese and jam."
"I found the flavor to be flat, and almost tasteless. I would recommend the manufacturer add more flavor to their recipe. Crunch appeal was good"
This is our preferred clam chowder . We like the natural taste with lots of potatoes. The only complaint is I think the soup can be creamier. Amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save.
"Needed the Instant Expresso Coffee for a chocolate Cake recipte. The package was more than I needed, but the cake turned out wonderful. Thanks Amazon...I couldn't find this item anywhere and a friend suggested I try Amazon.com."
.this stuff really tastes like peanut butter in the jar. If you're in w.w. the points are 1/2 the regular peanut butter. This means alot.
"My dog gets sick eating a lot of dog treats (even Milkbones), but has always done well with all the Booda bones.  She really loves them & they're good for getting rid of the tartar on her teeth.  I highly recommend these."
This really make my son's pupu happy. Everyday my son only take in half jar is enough to have soft pupu. And easy to be feed.
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUGSC"">Dromedary Sliced Pimientos, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Low calorie, light, delicious. Toss in with salad, mix with low-fat canned chicken, combine with grated cheese--they fit in with breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper, or even an informal, fast snack."
"Been taking Coconut Oil for YEARS.  This is the best on the retail market.  I wish it was in glass, but this is the one."
Satisfyingly sweet with lots of protien. I eat it as dessert or quick pick me up.
Thses cooffee pods are extra nice because there is much less plastic and work just as well.  The flovor is nice and bold without being bitter.  I have re-ordered and will continue to do so.
This frozen item arrived at least a week later than expected and at room temperature.<br />For a meat product (sausage) not good.<br />Just how long was it at room temperature???????????????<br /><br />Only saving grace...at least the dog didn't get sick
"Convenient because it comes in individual packs, and it tastes fine, but not very different from other instant coffee mixes of this type. Just tastes like instant coffee"
Received the ground flax seeds promptly. They sent 2 large bags that were packed very well. I have been using the product for 2 weeks and I am very well pleased. It is  finely ground and mixes well with any food or drink and tastes fine to me.
"THIS ITEM WAS VERY TASTY, THE PRESENTATION WAS ATTRACTIVE TOO...<br /><br />MAKES A GREAT GIFT"
This product is easy to make and has a great taste.  I just wish it was gluten free.  A simple change in the soy sauce used would make it that way just like the General Tsao's Chicken by the same company.
"This cat food is just the best!  I don't read ingredient lists for my own food nearly as often as I should for myself, but I read it for everything I feed my cats.  This is a great product and has been consistently good for several years now."
"This comes up on a gluten free search, but this is not gluten free. Soy sauce contains wheat. Unless it is specifically wheat free soy sauce, which is uncommon and not indicated."
"If you love espresso, but don't always have time to make a cup, then try these cookies.  I love these cookies.  They taste just like drinking a cup of espresso.  You get 2 hard cookies per individual package.  I love all 4 flavors as I am sure you will."
"Compared to what I pay at the normal grocery store for almonds, these are priced great, and taste fresh and crunchy. The sea salt taste is perfect, and the containers are conviently sized."
"I love these for a snack. I get a nice taste of chocolate and mint (in addition to the almond, of course), but it isn't super sweet. I hope Blue Diamond keeps coming out with more flavors. The Butter Toffee is great too."
"Yuck! Awful and since I expected beans instead of ground coffee, I'm even less impressed. I have a very good quality coffee maker, but this stuff stinks."
"Packing was efficient, and the product arrived promptly and in great shape. This product makes a great birthday party favors~! Kid's also love getting this as a gift. Very novel!"
"I love the Newman's pretzels, both the wheat and the spelt versions.  Not too salty and very crisp."
Discovered this at a local movie theater and will never eat popcorn without it again.  It is sooooooo good.
I would never buy this cocoa ever again. this was by far the foulest substance to ever cross my lips. DONT BUY THIS<br />no stars
just adore this tea. to bad that amazon doesn't usually ship teas to Europe so i have to find other ways...
"My dogs love their Greenies, and their teeth are pearly white from chewing on them.  The only problem is that Greenies are expensive, so I buy them in bulk on Amazon to keep the prices down a little bit,"
"I love these macaroons - even if I weren't GF, I would love them. But I get them from Glutenfree.com, a package of two cookies for .99 cents. If this can Amazon sells only has 6 cookies, it's horribly overpriced."
Roland Mackerel Fillets is a very good fish.  I got it from Amazon.com because this product was alot cheaper here than the store.  When we run out I will buy somemore. Also I love the free shipment...
these make a great snack at night when i am watching tv i get tried of air popcorn so i figure why not try these pork rinds there pretty good too
"I have tried many pods in my Senseo and this is probably my favorite.  Nice and bold.  Fits in the single pod holder, but you need to pack it down or wet the pod and pack it down depending on your machine."
"I have tried other whole grain wraps that reminded me somewhat of chewing cardboard.<br />This wrap tastes great! I did not find it overwhelming in flavor and it was a little nutty, and I love the amount of fiber."
I love that I no longer have to haul big bags of dog food home from the pet store.  This is the only food that seems to agree with my westie's digestive system.
"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable."
"I ordered these for a gift but would not give this as a gift.  The bag appeared wrinkled and old; in fact, the expiration date was only a few months away in March and I had intended to give for Christmas.  Returned instead."
The coffee flavor is what I find perfect in the morning using T disc from Maxwell House. Also it is 14oz a good size  & is so convenient one cup at at time no stale coffee...
"This stuff is just great. Give it a try, you won't regret it. Something that I really appreciate is the short ingredients list written in language that you don't need a PhD in chemistry to uncode :-)"
"theses cookies are good , oatmeal seems to be my favorite and best of all you would never know they were sugar free if the label didnt say it. i will purchase this product again ,they're that good!"
I love Gevalia Signature Crema coffee for it's rich taste and the incredible foam created automatically.<br />It is perfect for my taste. I have auto delivery so I never run out.
I just ordered 12 bags of these chips for my boyfriend for Christmas! They are amazing! If you like salt and pepper-you'll LOVE these!....Amazon really does have everything!
Everybody likes Cheetos.  This is a great way to buy them.  This is the size for including with a sandwich for lunch.
A quality product at a great price! Comes in especially handy at this time of year with all of the extra baking!
Our order arrived yesterday and this morning we placed an order for more - the taste is addictive!!  Just enough punch and spice.
"We live on this pasta at my gluten free house. However Amazon's ""bulk"" price is more expensive than buying it at Stop & Shop, which just seems wrong."
"If you like hot apple cider, this is pretty good.  I do add a few spices to it, but like it very much."
best chai you can get. we drink it a lot at my house and always keep it in stock. :)
"My dogs love these treats, they are perfect for training.  And small enough that you can use many without them packing on the pounds during training."
I LIKE THIS PRODUCT A LOT  THE LITTLE COOKIES ARE CRUNCH AND TASTY  A NICE TREAT!  GIVE IT A TRY = i THINK YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID
"My cat Brooklyn love this stuff, she can smell it from the other room and scampers in. Sprinkle a little on her scratch pad and she is in heaven. A little goes a long way on this stuff for one cat."
I am very pleased with this product.. The cappuccino flavor is delicious.. The best cappuccino flavor I have purshased anywhere for my k-cup machine..
This bean has a light nutty flavor and a good crema in my Rancilio Silvia. It's the best decaf I've tried in this machine yet.
"I absolutely love this tea.  It has a chocolate aroma, but a minty taste.  It only takes a small amount to brew a great cup of tea."
"Enjoyed them - has exotic flavor and are a bit sweet, if you like sweet. I prefer Strawberry twistzlers. The pomergrante is a nice topuch and I'm not sure whether it has any herbal efficacy."
"I feed this to my puppy along with the dry formula to get her to eat more. She now is licking the bowl clean!<br /><br />She does seem to have large bowel movements with this, but it is getting her eating and I know I can trust the ingredients."
"Love this product! Texture is just right -- touch gritty yet not heavy. If you plan on eating it with honey and butter, the sugar recommended in the recipe is enough, but for folks who prefer a sweeter cornbread, I would add more sugar or a bit of honey."
"This sunflower tastes really great, very original flavor not over salted. And the size of a sunflower seed is decent though not very large. Overall, it is the best sunflower seed that I ever eat in America."
"My dogs' absolutely loves these. -And I love the fact that they are not Rawhide, but still last them a while.  They are pricey, though--so always wait until they are on sale."
I've cut out carbs from diet and find it difficult to find something healthy and sustains me. Tanka Bites are delicious and they are not very spicy at all.
Every variety I have tried has been flavorful. There are no funny after tastes like with some other products. I would highly recomend. Great individual serving sizes which helps for 'good for you' snacking and portion size.
I am pleased that this Gluten flour works very well.  I bought this gluten flour because I think it's a pretty good deal for the amount that's in the package.  I highly recommend this product because it is versatile.
"This blend of coffee has a rich and robust flavor that enhances the coffee drinking experience.  I am not a fan of flavored coffees in general, but Kahlua is my preference when I hit the Keurig machine in the mornings, or at any other time."
"First of all, the inner plastic lining of the bag was punctured and a lot of the rice spilled out into the outer burlap bag.  The rice smelled and tasted like diesel fuel or something toxic.  I could not eat it and had to throw it all out."
Bogus product have tried four times and nothing has grown and I am an avid plant enthusiast  have the proper suppies and nothing BOGUS
"The brownies are delicious but my boyfriend (who has celiac disease) had a sudden and severe gluten reaction within 15 minutes of eating the first brownie.  He hadn't eaten anything else for several hours so we know it had to be the brownies.  Celiacs, eat at your own risk!!"
I bought this for my daughter but she doesn't like it.  She says it doesn't taste like chocolate.  I would say it's more sugary then chocolate.  I've even tried adding an extra scoop but she still doesn't think it taste right.  Maybe she's too use to Swiss Miss.
This product was awful. I will never buy it again.  It was grainy and had a terrible after taste.
"I have never ordered sea salt before. i thought this was great. I was afraid it would have some additional flavor that I wouldnt like. Instead it was fresh tasting & natural. I like the pink color, but glad it doesnt come out pink."
These things are great! We found them while traveling in BC when our daughter was 5 months. She got the hang of them real quick with no choking! Now we take them everywhere with us. They are a great snack and great entertainment.
"Just love the taste and tartness of these. They are not too sweet, have a little fizz to them, quench your thirst after a hard days work. The vitamins can't hurt either!"
My vet said she gives these daily to her dogs.  My dogs' teeth and breath have improved and these are not harsh on their digestive tract.
"I love these chips.  They are bursting with flavor.  You can dip them if you like, but they can easily stand alone. I like several of the FoodShouldTasteGood chips, but these are my favorite.  They have just the right amount of heat.  Yummy!"
I used this product as a substitute for honey for the making of meade. It produced a fantastic Agave Nectar wine that I flavored with Huckleberry. I will buy this product again.
Im very pleased with this product and highly recommend giving it a try.  ive ordered it before and will again.
"the shade of brown is perfect for what I need. The product was larger than I expected so it's a good price for the quantity and quality. Shipped on time, very happy with the experience"
"I find that cytomax works very well as a recovery drink after hard workouts.  I live in florida, and in the summers it helps me recover quicker than gatorade.  Also, the price is much cheaper than at the local health store.<br />Good deal all around."
This product is a great snack for anyone trying to stay on a low carb diet.  I like that the fat content is low and calories are on the low side as well
"""Both"" of Gloria Jean's ""Hazelnut"" and ""Vanilla"" packs of 50 contained only ""49.""  Does Gloria Jean's have a fundamental packaging problem ??"
I have two 1-year old pups and they love their Puppersoni's!! I offer them other treats but they turn their noses up to them and hold out for their pupperoni treat.
These are better than the Special K things. These actually taste like potato (because they are potato). I describe them as a mix between Munchos and O'Boises. Delicious.
These 4 mint flavors are one of the best. I love them. I have bought and used 3 packs. One peace lasts 2 to 4 hours. I would definitely recommend these to everyone.
This is probably my favorite cereal :)<br />Love the honey and the crunchy cheerios!<br /><br />Amazon is super fast and easy since it saves me a trip to the store.
"I just ordered these vanilla caramels, along with a bag of the sea salt kind.  Although I am more partial to the sea salt AvenueSweets caramels, these are also great - very fresh, soft and chewy, with a hint of vanilla."
I love this stuff; slightly honey flavored- delicious in coffee. It's a wonderful product and so much less expensive than if you buy it at the store.
"This is spicy but tastes great.  However, its not for folks that don't like jalapenos.  My kids didn't care for it and they are used to spicy stuff.  I would use sparingly at first.  Plan to keep some in my fridge for taco night!"
Love this cappuccino. Had a hard time finding it. So ordered in bulk :) Will continue ordering. Both my husband and I love it.
"Our puppy LOVES these.  As soon as she has one in her mouth, she runs to some comfy spot to chew on it.  We love these because they are just chicken and no chemicals."
Put it everywhere you would use Rooster Sauce for extra garlic.  Really adds a nice zing to Pot-stickers.  Skillet Breakfast is my favorite with really crunchy hash browns. Anything that needs a kick will work.
I needed Split Mung Beans to make Thai dessert and it turned out great.  Just like what I wanted!
Love this flavor. A very nice and clean taste.  One of my best ways<br />to fix this is to mix it with the sweetened White Tea with Blueberry.<br />Cuts down on the calories by using the sugar free sticks.  I will continue to buy this product.
I loved this stuff so much all I needed was the jar and a spoon.  I will order more...again and again and again......
"It seems like I am always sampling new coffee for my K-cup brewer, but for consistent good taste this is one of the best. It makes a quality cup of coffee with real coffee taste."
"Love them, very ""gingery"".  Great with your favorite tea or coffee.  Love that they are using natural ingredients."
"We eat at PF Changs fairly often and love the jasmine blackberry tea they serve. Looked all over for something like it, found China Mist and are delighted that it is the exact, same tea!"
I just got a Keurig brewer and have been trying different coffees.  This is one of the best.  It makes a full flavored 8 oz cup.  I have been very happy with all the Coffee People products.
This acts as a baking powder with a vanilla flavor to it.  It is used in authentic Italian cookie and cake recipes and is often difficult to find in grocery stores.  I love this stuff!
"I seldom drink decaf, but that's all my partner drinks.  We've tried several types, but the best is Green Mountain Decaf.  It doesn't have the decaf weakness that so many others have.  It comes closest to REAL coffee!"
Sunbutter is a great substitute for peanut butter and it tastes great. Really good if your trying to go paleo and don't want to give up pb.
These are great tasting and provide the highest amount of protein than any bar I have tried.  They are not low in calorie so I would not recommend them for snacking.  They are great as a meal replacement as the product states.
Good finishing glaze.  I little different than what I have used in the past.  It is worth having in the pantry for a little change.
I bought this popcorn when my in laws got me a popcorn maker for christmas.  This popcorn is BETTER then movie theater popcorn!  I will definitely be buying more once I run out!
"I add a small amount of millet to the homemade cat food recipe I make each week.  This brand is excellent, and the seller ships quickly."
"Wow!  I cannot believe that so much<br /><br />good healthy stuff could be in such<br /><br />a small package! The calorie count,<br /><br />etc. would help others choose this<br /><br />unique food bar."
Very quick delivery of very stale gum.  I threw it out it was so bad.  Must have been on the shelf for a while where the mice couldn't find it.
"Obviously, the people in my household love these.  I think I managed to get one pack out of the 24.  Great price on a great product."
"my dog loves them and I think they help her, even though we do have her on medicine for her hips. You can also break them in half if you don't want to give the full treat all the time."
Our dogs love these chews. We give them each one a day. The chews definitly help keep their teeth clean and improves their breath!
I love the great taste of these K-Cups. I just reorder for the 3rd time and I am trying the other flavors.
This kit has been amazing! We're getting big meaty shiitakes just a week after starting. The instructions include photos and are very thorough. I highly recommend it.
"The item came as described and rather quickly, which I was pleased with. Can't complain about this purchase at all."
It is definitely not clear from the product description that this version is loose tea rather than tea bags. Just be aware that you will have to strain the tea or purchase a reusable metal teabag in order to brew and drink it.
This is a good quality organic coconut oil. Only suggestion I would make to the manufacturer - use glass instead of plastic.
"No, these do not taste exactly like potato chips, they taste kind of like diet-food.  But not in a bad way.  They are by far the BEST alternative to potato chips.  Waaayyy better than those ""baked"" potato chips."
"Well, for the price I got this at, it cannot be beat.  Sure, the raisins have some sugar on them, but so what.  This is a classic cereal and it tastes great.  My kids love it!"
"For the life of me I cannot remember where I originally bought this, but mixed with olive oil it makes a to-die-for chicken marinade!"
"The jerky was just as I hoped for, mmm good and tasty.  I have eaten alot of beef jerky in the past and found it to be too stringy sometime.  This turkey jerky was great."
"I find these better than the candy sugar wafers; they are absolutely delicious and I love them. It's hard to believe that they are protein bars based on the taste, but they do have a little bit of fat and too little protein, but they are perfect anyway"
I love this tea by itself or combined in my own Russian Caravan blend. Assam combined with hint of Lapsang Souchong and an oolong is delicious. I like knowing exactly what teas are in a blend. Most purchased blends do not give details on their labels.
"I've bought this before and been pleased, this case is undrinkable. I thought the bad reviews were unreasonable because I liked the product, but now I see. I recommend you get yours from the healthfood store so you can return it easily if its from a bad batch."
Enjoy this coffee very much good flavor one of our favorites.  We like stronger coffer and this fits the bill.
"These hemp seeds, while they contain more pieces of hull than most, are the freshest tasting hemp seeds I have purchased."
We use agave nectar to sweeten homemade prickly pear lemonade.<br />It is so delicious...and so much better for you than sugar.
"Yes, I tasted them - they taste like chemicals but I guess that's what you should expect from a joint supplement.  My Shih tzu & Pekingese would not eat them."
"I'm thoroughly enjoying my Butter Toffee coffee in K-Cup form from Gloria Jean's. The coffee tastes great, and the package arrived perfectly - no damage at all. Often one or two K-Cups burst or crack during shipment, but this did not happen. I will order again."
"This pasta is excellent for hot dishes and cold salads.  Although whole wheat, it does not overpower any sauce or other ingredients."
The elderberry jelly is hard to find and is not stocked in our small town store.  The box arrived in good condition and the jelly is delicious.
I bought this Tea for my girlfriend who is ery health conscious. So far she is loving it and it tastes good too. :)
Many of the common brands of herbal teas are not palatable to me.  This one is very good.  I enjoy it.  Easy on the palette and easy on the digestion track.  Yum!  Just like any high quality tea.
Starkist is the best as of late..I change my 4stars to 5stars..some online fan changed my mind..
I just received a new Keurig and have tried a couple of different K-Cup varieties. I just have to say that for a smooth cup of plain deliciousness this is one of my top picks!
"My Italian Greyhound's digestive system is very delicate.  He used to have frequent, eye-wateringly stinky farts until we switched to this food.  He has nice firm poops now too!"
This product is the best dressing!  I wish they would sell it in the stores. It would put the other box dressings to shame. This is a must buy!
"this broth is a real nasty taste, omg there is no flavor in these and I got a heck of a lot of these. The sodium in these are very high as well."
I have ordered these nuti dents in the past and everytime it has gotten here in just few days. Wonderful product. The dogs love them.
"These two-pound bags appear fresher than the 1 pound boxes I was buying at the local Vons grocery store. They are clean, not moldy. No stems or twigs. This is a good product and I am getting them regularly through Amazon's ""Subscribe abd Save"" feature."
They looked super cute on cupcakes and tasted good too!  There were plenty in the package for way more cupcakes then I made.  I made about 24 cupcakes and have a lot left over.
It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.
I love this oil! I use it for everything from cooking with it to using it as a moisturizer and on my scalp for dandruff. I would totally recommend this to everyone!
I received the popcorn in a timely manner. The package was in perfect condition and the popcorn tasted great.
These are as tasty as ever but they are getting so small they will soon be golf ball sized. This trend to shrinking products instead of raising prices does not fool anyone
I sent this to my Mother to store for emergency situations. She said it did not taste like buttermilk at all. OK for cooking but not drinking.
This conditioner is light and works great.<br />Its not heavy and wont weight down my dogs coat- leaves it nice and fluffy and soft.<br />Smells terrific!<br /><br />I recommend it!
I love the flavor of this product and the best part is that is sugar free. They came in plastic bottles instead glass (the ones i bought before at the supermarket were glass and half side and almost the same price). Very good deal
These were nummy!  a bit over priced for one pound of nuts - but the quality is truly there! :)<br />I would order again!
I eat this almost every day in my oatmeal. It's also delicious in a smoothie with banana and almond milk. The bigger bag is a better value than the individual jar.
"Love anything Lemon...this is decaf white tea. It is hard to find in any stores, so I get it here on Amazon. Good price - fast delivery. Great fresh light tea for summer."
"This is a great product!  makes it easy to steam and leave the room-you don't have to worry about overboiling veggies/fruits, easy to clean, small, cute, blender sufficient, perfect size.  it's pretty expesnive but I think worth it especially if you plan on having more kids!"
"I enjoy the Coffee Master Flavored Coffee,""Jamaican Me Crazy"".  It is very tasty and I will reorder when empty.  The ""Butter Pecan""flavor is great also, and I will highly recommend both flavors. This is high premium coffee.  You will not be disappointed.  The flavor is just right not overbearing."
As an aid to tranquility and sleep -- what it is marketed for -- it is not very effective.  But for chronic severe constipation it is the only thing that has worked for me.
Very very yummy graham crackers in an easier to manage size! Plus the stay fresh packaging ensures that these crackers always stay fresh and crisp!
"We use coconut oil instead of butter and shortening for baking and on the table.<br />This is one of the best for texture and taste.<br />The price is very good, and the delivery fast."
The beans smell nice but they were super hard a few even broke in half as I was opening the package. I wish they would have been fresher because I really love the smell of them.
"Well, though some others don't like...I happen to love them.  Apparently I am not the only one, since every store in my area keeps selling out of them the day they re-stock.  Delicious!"
"These are just too tasty. Seriously, they need to come in a big box, like FiddleFaddle. I could munch on these all day long. I don't get to, as my wife and kids keep cleaning out my supplies before I can get to them. Damn you, 8-5PM job!!!"
try  them they work.  I tried everything you could imagine.  My cat loves these.  Make sure your hand that handles the  pill does not come in contact with the pill pocket in any way.
"THe noodles were very rubbery & the texture was not at all like food. You could bury it in sauce to make it taste like food, but cant get away from the rubbery texture. I do not recommend this product."
Our pup - Siberian Husky - loves this food.  He eats approximately 2 cups of this food in no time.
Got these in Amazon Warehouse...very crunchy..I like it that they come in small bags..helps with portion control. These are about as good as it gets..so stock up when they go on sale.
"I ordered these and recieved Quaker 5-Minutes Quick Grits instead of Old Fashioned.  No problem returning them (other than the hassle), but not what I was expecting"
Always had trouble trying to brush my dog's teeth; thought I would try the Greenies Petite (16 lb cockapoo). They are plenty big enough. She has one everyday loves them and her teeth are looking very healthy; no tartar build up. Definitely recommend them.
"These were great.<br /><br />But I prefer softer, more moist, and sweeter.<br /><br />However, it was a nice treat and snack and enjoyable"
"Tried this as a substitute for the fantastic pour over cheddar popcorn, and I'm stuck with a flavorless, dull, lackluster sub by the same exact company. A rather poor substitute, indeed."
"We enjoy the taste and, having flax in it, is good for you. We can take care of our bodies and like the taste. A win-win!"
"Our dogs were feeling their ages until we began feeding them Happy Hips dog food. Now they feel GREAT! And ordering it from Amazon.com was easy and convienient.  Try it, you'll like it!"
"Plant arrived budded in perfect condition. As far as packing is concerned, I've never seen such careful attention to insuring that the plants were protected: each was carefully wrapped and the entire order enveloped in an insulating sheet. This is my second order. There will be many more."
"This is my favorite herb mix.  Its similar to basic Italian seasoning, but with a more distinct and much more Mediterranean flavor."
"I love my snacks but I don't love all the sodium most of them have.  Snyder's of Hanover unsalted minis taste terrific and satisfy my cravings for a crunchy, low sodium snack. At twenty pretzels per serving, you feel like you're getting a substantial amount as well."
"I love the superfruit acaia flavor in this green tea...I kow green tea is soooooooo good for me but I dont care for the taste of it...however, this version is very enjoyable with none of the bitter green tea taste.  this price was also very reasonable."
"there is no taste, like you are drinking hot water, even after letting it steep.  perhaps it has been sitting on someone's shelf too long before shipping.  will not purchase this flavor or from this amazon provider"
"Good oil at a decent price. If you want to spend a bit more, I also like the ""Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil"" at around $30. As always, use the subscription and stop whenever you want."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>Dogswell chicken jerky is now made in China.  The FDA has warned against dog food products made in China.  Don't risk it!"
"Stash Chai Grenn Tea is the best tasting tea I have tasted, this will be my only brand for now on! also it is a great way to lose weight!"
Purchased this item to clean up the counter in my kitchen.  Its looks so good now.  The reveiws I read were helpful and I made the right decision.  Quality product.
I've been low carbing for some time.  These chips are great.  They really satisfy the need to munch on something salty and crunchy.  My only complaint is that the bags are not bigger!  My dog loves them also!
"I've tried every possible flavor K-cup I can get my hands on, and both my husband and I agree, the Kona Blend is our hands-down favorite.  Love it!!"
"One ingredient, made in the USA.  Fantastic, my vet says these are so good for them that I can free feed it.  The only problem is that it's $$$ and my cats have stolen the bag from the pantry and ripped it open to help themselves!"
I expected full-bodied Columbian flavor as in other brand pods. However it was so weak in even a 6oz cup that i had to use 2 pods. Very disappointing. But did receive it quickly. Good if you like weak coffee
This yummy concoction was a nice little treat.  The bright lemon taste with the ginger made for an excellent remedy for a winter's cold.  It even tasted good cold.
"This is my favorite unflavored K Cup coffee.  I've tried many brands and flavors, and this one comes out on top.  It doesn't taste watered down like some of them do.  It has an excellent, medium-bodied flavor."
"I bought this as a gift for someone who likes pineapple. I'm not a huge fan, but tried a piece. It is soooo good. Tastes just like pineapple, plus is soft and chewy, not like hard licorice at all. Highly recommend this product."
"This is a great product, coffee is great and price is even better.  Delivery was prompt without any issues I would certainly order again."
"I have about 2 years using this seasoning when I make my salmon .. just add lemon juice, olive oil and the chef paul sazoning magic. after I put the grill and I have a meal as any gourmet restaurant would serve. simply recommend this product 100%"
"This healthy gluten-free cereal is the best on the market, that I have tried. Since I can't ingest oats, it provides all the sustainance that my body needs to get off to a great day! The nuts and seeds and raisins help balance your blood sugar too!"
It works great for gluten free flour. I was able to make 100% Spelt bread because of this product. I can't complain.
My son likes graham crackers and I love it too. I had to get it on here at amazon subscribe and save. You do save a little bit but the awesome part is getting it right at your day in a just a day or two.
We use these popcorn packs for our party rental business. We can keep enough in stock. They are easy for our customers to use and taste great!
"This powdered lime preparation is the closest thing to fresh citrus ever.  It's handy for mixed drinks, salad dressing, etc. It's priced well and I would definitely reorder it and recommend it to friends."
Excellent coffee with a hint of nutty flavor and I like the decaf which allows me to comply with heart specialist instructions; I can enjoy it any time of the day!
"I used to say i'd never buy my groceries at a hardwhare store, but  chef boyardee is cheep there. .88/can. then they go on sale even cheaper."
Our new son loves this formula.  We had to ditch breast feeding due to my wife's limited supply and our aggressive eater.  He has definitely shown a preference to this formula over Similac and Enfamil.
"I could eat a bag of these every day.  My adult kids love them, too.  I wish the cinnamon flavor was available in the larger size bag (like the naked and parmesan garlic are)."
So enjoyable to sit back with a soothing cup of hot tea.  A relaxing few minutes out of a day.
"I had never had this flavor of coffee, it is great. I love stong coffee and it hit the spot. The price is exceptional as well!!!"
Simply the best kool aid drink ever.  I don't know why its not stocked and marketed.<br />Better than canada dry cactus coolers.
My cats love this food. They always lick every last morsel of it. I love it too because it is one of the best values for a high-quality canned food.
"I am not thrilled at adding more soy to my menu as I do not want the plant estogen, but they had good flavor...chewy and cunchy with just the right hint of chocolate"
Tasty.  Better than others I've bought and good price.  The bag helps keep them moist too as opposed to the canisters.
A hard to find locally product.  Arrived quickly will packed and fresh.<br />Just like the family had purchased in Japan.  Happy that it can be ordered and received at a very reasonable price
"They arrived in a nicely packaged box, so unbelievably cute and yummy. Will definitely buy from again."
"Delicious!!! I also own a Keurig machine and as much as coffe and tea are really good, the chocolate mixes are all watery. This is the first real hot chocolate I get from a machine that uses pods. Try it for yourself, you'll love it. Great Holiday gift, too!"
"These are great chips. Came in one box, and we have been working our way through them. Fresh, and the 3 oz. bags are a great size."
"Delicious and good for you too!  We are on the South Beach diet and decided to try this cereal.  Whether or not you are on the SBD, you will really enjoy this cereal."
Curry powder is a blend of several spices. If you're looking for authentic Oriental Curry flavor this is the stuff. No American Curry powder comes close. Anything else is just... disappointing. If you're making Indian curry then perhaps there are alternatives.
"This product is delicious.  Not only that, it was delivered quickly and arrived in excellent condition.  It has a great flavor, not bitter.  I hadn't ordered this before but was pleasantly delighted by the prompt delivery and delicious taste and aroma."
My wife and I enjoyed the grade B syrup taste and its strong flavor! We started using this after a diet recommendation and now we're hooked to this great buy!
"Great product, best price found we use it all the time in our restaurant.Always arrive on time."
The first shipment was lost but the vendor is quickly to respond with a new shipment after receiving feedback.  Dustin made the point to explain where anything could happen to the shipment and I agreed with him.  I based my satisfaction on the recovery process.
"Not all flavors are equal, so choose carefully to find one that matches your taste buds.  I, personally, love the cherry pie.  Who needs any other snack?  Not me!"
"This coffee is not great. It has burned, sour, and bitter taste to the skip. I will skip it next time."
"Bombay Basmati Rice Brown, 32-Ounce (Pack of 6) Ordering this product was very good process and what has been used was good. No complaints!"
This is one of the secret ingredients in KFC's original recipe. It will become your secret recipe in the future!
"The product ""Smoked Baby Clams"" was full of sand and not edible.  Obviously I won't buy again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EEWZC8"">Crown Prince Smoked Baby Clams in Oil;3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"
We were thrilled to find these.  They will be a staple in our home.
"Have been buying these without looking  the box. I got one box and the bars were broken, stale and moldy tasting.  I looked for an expiration date, and  I noticed they were madi in CHINA. WTF. Not buying these anymore. Blecht."
"Excellent product, adds great taste to all meats and tenderizes even the toughest piece of beef"
"I absolutely love this bakery, their cookies are so awesome. Definitely going to order some more in the near future!"
"I don't like campbell's tomato soup and this tastes a lot like it, except that it has tofu, some vegies and a slight curry flavor. There wasn't anything special about the flavor or taste. I will finish the bag but won't be ordering more."
"Enjoy this treat on my low carb diet. Nice to have a ""chip"" to dip"
Shipping was quick. I've used this for my hair as well as drank it. Does what it says. I will continue to use it.
WE FOUND THIS DOG FOOD ONLINE AND COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT IT WAS 95% BEEF WITH NO FILLERS! THIS IS HARD TO BEAT FOR PET FOOD. OUR GUYS LOVE THIS FOOD AND IT IS NICE TO KNOW IT ISN'T FILLED WITH JUNK. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOOD.
"I really like this version of the Oberto Beef Jerky.  It's not too dry and is quite tasty.  I get it for snacks at work, high protein, low fat and it satisfies my craving something salty so I'm not tempted to buy a bag of chips to nibble on."
All boxes were fresh. Typical Apple Jacks cereal. Doesn't really taste like apples. Sometimes you'll get clumps of sugar that are really hard.<br /><br />Great if you want a sweet cereal.
"I like this cereal.  I don't add sugar; like it just the way it is.  I like the subscribe and save, it is reasonable priced and arrives quickly at the time its suppose to."
I've bought 2 of these so far for my 1 year beagle that loves to chew. He loves them and goes between this and his retriever rolls. Received the antlers quickly both times and they were very clean and the perfect size for my chewer.
"Love, love, love this product.  So rich and a bit sweet.  Save this for those special dishes calling for Balsamic Vinegar, or indulge daily with a drizzle over any salad.  Yummy!!! Especially nice with Caprese Salad. Love it!!"
Loved it too well.  Gone in less than a month.  I have a 60 pound GSD.  I would get it again.
"It contains too much fat and when you bite it than you can feel the fat in your mouth, it's disgusting."
their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste  a little sweet.
It is a spicey energy drink! If you like spicey stuff you will more than likey like this stuff! It is definitely worth a try! It is very powerful for tiny cans! Zing zing zing!!!!
"The Sugar Free Peach rings were delicious.  They are almost as good as the real peach rings, just not as tart.  I just ordered a second bag!!"
"Soooooooo good.  This is some seriously high-end jam.  And yes, it's fabulous with goat cheese.  Also lovely with a nice sharp gouda.  Yum."
"This is not up to par for Jack Links products.  These are awful!  Gritty, they taste like I imagine dog snacks would taste."
I love raspberry fig bars and I LOVE these.  I eat them everyday for snack and never get sick of them.
This is the best expresso I have ever had.<br />For 20 years have spend 4 weeks there in Italy and this is primarily distributed to cafes.<br />You can't find it in stores there.<br />It is a powdery grind and this coffee works fine with a stove top expresso maker.
"We bought this product because my wife and I had started the Ducan Diet.  It was a reasonable price, tasted good, and was delivered even earlier than expected.  It's all good."
"This product was absolutely delicious, we prefer the dark chocolate and the quality was excellent, the delivery was quick and packaged really well. I would highly recommend ordering this item and anything else from igourmet.com."
I bought this because I got reading all the fantastic 5 star reviews. This stuff is so terrible I couldn't take more than a few bites and threw the rest in the garbage. Now I'm stuck with 5 more soups left that I'll just donate to the homeless.
The coffee was great. Spent some time in Jamaica and got to love the coffee. Nice to get in back home as well.
"These burnt flavored, wannabe pretzels, are disgusting.  For the price I paid, I am extremely disappointed.  ALL WRONG!  Won't be buying this product, or anything else from this brand."
"The service was excellent - good company who called me at home to verify info on the order, but the taste wasn't very good. I was rather disappointed. I wouldn't purchase again."
Normally I put 2 sugars and cream in my coffee. Not this stuff. It's perfect just as it is. VERY SWEET
"i love these bars. i've tried all the flavors and they're all pretty darned great. i eat them more for a snack than a meal because they aren't as filling as i'd like, but they're great for a snack or sugar craving."
First off let me state Amazon and the retailer did nothing wrong. The problem I had is with the product itself. Even tho it was well within it's expiration date when I opened it it was obviously stale and nasty to eat.
"I've ordered this coffee about 2 months ago. It has fairly good taste and smell, but not the perfect one.<br /><br />This ground coffee may be intended for ""French Press."" It is too coarse for hand-drip.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied with this coffee at this price."
Highly recommend this soup. I use less water to make it thicker and I add some broccoli and corn to the mixture and pour it on top of baked potatoes. Yummy!
I carry the Kind Bars with me all the time.  I have a blood sugar concern that is controlled by<br />diet and the Kind Bars help keep my blood sugar stable
"I love this coffee!  It's the next best thing to espresso.  If you like your coffee strong and dark, without being bitter, this is for you."
"This tea is very good. It's SUPER lemony, so if you don't like that then you may not like the tea, but I love it. I prepare the tea with hot water and add 1-2 splenda packets, and am good to go!"
This is my all time favorite tea.  The flavors are light and perfectly balanced.  It is excellent hot or iced.
"A great company and well priced organic chocolate. The Cherry is very good, not overpowering. This is one of my favorite flavor of thier chocolates I have had so far (Blueberry,Peanut Butter, Milk Chocolate, and Dark Chocolate)."
Nice!  Great for after coffe or meals.  Makes your mouth feel clean and refreshed!!
Our dog loves this stuff.  Ground up and sprinkled on his dry food he just gobbles it up.  No additives or fillers no carbs. We also use as a treat.  Best price at Amazon and quick delivery.
"Do not buy these if you are looking for value for the price.  These are tiny chews that are paper thin.  Pathetic kind of dog chew, I could have gnawed through this.  Very disappointed."
This product is terrific.  Delivered on time.  Will buy again.<br />Brings me back to my childhood.  This is one of the best comfort foods.
This makes great iced tea. More flavor than regular tea. Refreshing. Recommend it. Hard to find in stores. Get it here.
I look forward to this coffee in the morning. I think Tully's is the best brand for Kcups I have tried.
"I love this product.  I use it for meal replacement (breakfast), and I do not get hungry until lunch time.  I will continue to order this product as I need it."
I love this fudge. It just literally takes 5 minutes from start to finish and I think it tastes wonderful.  I like to give these as gifts during the holidays.  People can make their own fudge in minutes.<br />Sharon Jensen
The bangers were as good as what I had when I was over seas. A+ I will buy more later. Very good product and great shipping.
Use it as a secret ingredient in a certain recipe of mine.  Good stuff.
This is my #1 favorite coffee. Blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect.  Thank you!!<br /><br />Question:  why was I charged postage on this brand when I have never paid on any other brand of K-Cups from Amazon
I got the bbq flavor jerky as a free sample and LOVED it more than the other 3 flavors I purchased! It was moist and tender and absolutely delicious. Will be ordering more. Keep up the good work!
"I'm sorry all the stores seem to have discontinued this product -- but with Amazon.com, you can buy it over the Internet. Magical!  My product came neatly packed into a large cardboard box."
"I have an inexpensive espresso machine from Delonghi (no fancy schmancy pump).  When I use Lavazza coffee in the machine, I make lattes that tastes a whole lot better than what I get at my neighborhood Starbucks."
"I've purchased Wellness before: my border collie is epileptic. The omega fish oils and organic ingredients have improved her health, helped to reduce her seizures, and improved her sister's health as well. I highly recommend the product: it arrived promptly and in perfect condition."
"I LOVE Bigelow teas, yet the Vanilla Chai is one of my faves. It's so tastey! With a little stevia and coconut milk - delicious!"
I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
This tea is my favorite. It is sweet and a wonderful after dinner treat. Hard to find in the supermarkets.
If I could only find these locally.  An excellent snack with 0 fat and very few carbohydrates. They are a bit pricey but seem worth your money.
This is a great cereal for the wheat-free folks. The six pack is quite a bit of cereal.  Really.  I keep the extra ones in my freezer to keep them fresh.
These bars give you 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber.  They taste great and fill you up.  I love them.
"On the go all the time, but still want to eat healthy? Are you sick of all the dry, mediceney tasting protein bars? Then these Power Crunch bars are for you. Seriously, the best bars I have EVER had. Great stuff!!"
I couldn't even finish the cup of this. It was extremely sweet and I could feel a cavity coming on! I'll be offloading the rest of this box...
"Not exactly perfect for extreme low-carb dieting, but still good enough compared to your average sugar-infused muffin mix. Flavor is pretty good, though the muffins are lacking something to round them off, but they are moist and have a good texture."
"I cook alot, and use cinnamon in many baked goods.  I've use many types, but this seems to be the best, to my palate."
"When Costco stopped carrying our favorite, we had to find another source that was reasonably priced.  This product fit the bill."
"These bars are delicious. Nuts and berries kind of stuck together with a thin layer of sweet, honey-like glaze. My only complaint is that they are not particularly filling - after I eat one I want to reach for another one."
Best K cup around. A must try!  Amazon ships quickly and in one piece. I'd recommend the coffee as well as going through Amazon to order this coffee from.  Thank you for a great experience.
"I ordered these for business reasons and they are no run-of-the-mill chocolates!  Would highly recommend, alot of chocolates for the price."
"Good service as shipment arrived shortly after ordering.  Good product, much more healthy for cats than most of the readily available foods.  And our cats really like this food."
"I do enjoy most of the Popchip flavours.  This one has a nice balance and I don't get tired too quickly of this flavor.  Better than the jalape&ntilde;o flavor, but I still prefer the multi-pack."
"I spread this on my round nuts, with vanilla ice cream.  Also good for smoothies, or for pet goats, they love the stuff.  You get used to the taste really fast since its naturally sweet, not processed.  Tastes more healthly than the classic socket in the nuts Coconut Bags."
"received the first tree withered. We had quite a cold spell and it did not survive the shipping. Contacted the business and they sent another. Thankful for good, prompt customer service"
"Shipping papers still stated 50%, but the actual product label indicated 43%.  Too bad, Yamate chocolates are great, I'd hate to see them start reducing quality :-("
Cannot buy this product locally.  Quality was excellent.  Each package is enough for two plus meals for two people so it was worth the shipping.
"I look forward to this every fall! If you love pumpkin you will love this; it is delicious! The only bad thing for me, is when GMCR stops selling it each year :( But, then there is Spicy Eggnog!"
"My dog is absolutely crazy about these treats, and that they are made in the U.S.A. is just icing on the cake."
"These bars taste wonderful and are not full of sugar.  I am a repeat customer.  I haven't lost weight, but I don't see any gain when I eat one bar a day."
"It's good cereal for sure, but no way is it worth $10 a box.This HAS to be an error, it's about $5-6 in the grocery store.My local store that carried it got sold and no longer has it in stock,but for $10 I'll do without."
This product arrived on time.  My wife loves these but they are sometimes hard to find in the stores.  Costco offers them for less when they have them which is not often.
"Some of these are quite tasty, but all are too salty. Way too much sodium.<br />The cheddar flavor is kind of like different-shaped cheetos, quite tasty.<br />Parmesan garlic on the other hand is terrible. Extremely garlicky with no parmesan taste at all, and too salty."
"It just doesn't have the amount of licorice flavor as the Aussie made product.  Or, for that matter, most other quality licorice products.  I am still enjoying it, just not as much as I had hoped to."
"I like the fruit flavored versions of Yummy Earth, but roadside root beer drops are simply awesome. It's better than any other hard root beer flavored candy I've tried. I never get tired of the flavor, and a bag this size can last a long time, sometimes for months."
I'm thoroughly pleased with this tea. I purchased it based on the recommendation of another reviewer. It brought me back to times I would sit and sip a similar tea with my grandmother. It is a healthy brew and very flavorful. High recommended.
"Ordered this as I had been told it was no longer available in stores....however, since then, have seen it back in some grocery stores.  Never mind, I am glad to have it stockpiled..."
This is amazing. A must have.  I use this product daily.  I love the smell.  I have used many different brands but I like this one the best.
"Great to have on hand for recipes calling for cream of mushroom soup. Much better than other brands, that have so many added things to it. I use this alot in cooking."
Much better than pre-ground coffee in the can.  The best part was that it was still Folgers...which is good pre-ground or otherwise!
"I love the Pomegranate Berry Cytomax.  At the Death Ride, they served this drink, and I tried it for the first time.  The drink worked great and was easy to digest.  I drank it for 13+ hours while riding 129 miles and climbing 15,000 feet."
"I used to buy these packs from the grocery store, now I will never buy from the grocer again. These were 100x more fresh than the store bought ones I was buying. Perfect on my salads at lunch."
"I have always wanted to try brewing real English tea. I bought these for my Keurig, and they were so, so much better than my normal tea bags.  They may not be as good as real, brewed tea, but I think they're delicious."
"This ""Chili"" is the best!!! Especially, the myriad ways to fix it. Service was especially fast and good. Will do again when I need more!!!"
If you need to stay awake this will do it. I can't drink one every day but when I do drink one I am wide awake and alert. Maybe also a little jumpy. Doesn't seem to have a crash at the end.
i have four kids and we all love these. i never bought pop tarts for them until i saw these. i bought them initially at earthfare but it is much cheaper to get them here. we have also tried the brown sugar cinnamon but these are the best. :)
I received a very generous sample pack from Brooklyn Bean. I'm not a strong coffee drinker and prefer this light roast. It's very flavorful and my new favorite! I didn't have any coffee grain explosions as another reviewer mentioned.
I love this popcorn! The taste is great and it gives me the oppertunity to eat a health popcorn with flavor. But no matter how much I try I can only seem to get half the corn in the bag to pop.
"Azteca Fire isn't as spicy as it claims, and that's not a bad thing. It's complex, chocolatey and delicious and we have to ration ourselves lest we spend all our spare money on it. :-)"
"THIS COFFEE IS GOOD. I LIKE DARK COFFEE.  I PREFER THE DARKER COFFEE, BUT THIS WAS STILL GOOD.  NOT TO BOLD."
"i bought this amazing babycook to provide healthy meals for my daughter ,but when i started using it i realized that the steamer doesn't work at all ! i don't know what to do."
These just maybe one of my favorite Kind bars. I enjoy grabbing one as that chocolate craving comes in the afternoon. This bar is a must for snacks. I will definatly keep these bars coming every month.
"The product is excellent, sweet and juicy. I like the small jars. The parcel came in time, but the packaging wasn't enough to hold such a heavy weight, one of the jar was broken. But Amazon resolved this problem very quickly and efficiently. I'll definitely order this product again."
"Sweet, crunchy and healthy. The kids love these and so do the adults. I do wish the pieces were a bit bigger but still love them!"
"Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence."
"Excellent texture to finish all of my favorite foods, especially fresh picked garden tomatoes and a perfectly seared steak...need I say more?"
"I like this coffee anytime during the day.  It has a nice fresh taste. no aftertaste, very enjoyable would recommend this flavor to other customers"
We support a number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and several of them request peppered jerky above everything else.
This is the best white mocha drink mix I have tasted.  I usually add 1 tablespoon because I like my drink with just a slight flavor.  In the summer I also add it with milk and then blend it with vanilla ice cream to make great tasting milk shakes.
I looove wheat nuts!  And wheat nuts are so healthy! They are not marketed in this area so I was really glad to get them from my amazon source!
This coffee is very good. Has a nice rich flavor! Doesn't have a watered down taste at all. The keurig coffee by green mountain is a good true cup of coffee.
"Great product, very happy with the seller, items arrived very promptly and in new shape"
"I have been buying this chai for 5 years now.  It is the best!  I have tried the Vanilla and the Sugar Free Vanilla.  They are good too, but the green tea chai is perfect.  Not too sweet.  Fantastic product!"
"This tastes rich, creamy, and smooth with just the right amount of caffeine kick I need in the morning. The only pitfalls would be high calorie content and some genetically modified ingredients thrown in."
My neighborhood groceries no longer carried this wonderful product. Now I have a pack of three. Superb!
"I have tried several K-Cup hot chocolates.  This is the best, rich and chocolaty.  Apparently has the most chocolate of all."
"This apple cider is delicious and fairly priced. I bought two boxes at first, then ordered 3 more as a result of its good flavor!"
"The tea has a well balanced flavor of green tea & jasmine tea.  It tastes good alone, but a friend recommended adding & stirring just a little bit of honey to go along with every cup.  Either way, it has become one of my favorite teas."
I just received this salt.  Yum!<br /><br />Finely ground and in a very sturdy resealable package.  I will  keep buying this.
I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water.
Without a doubt this is by far the BEST beef gravy mix that my family has ever had.  I tastes just like I made it from scratch from a pot drippings.  My grandson eats it on his all his beef and smothers his french fries with it too.
"My 8 month old loves these. He hardly swallows one bite before he's already opened his mouth for the next bite. I make my own baby food when I have time, but when I don't, this is a great alternative."
"the flavor palet for this coffee is deep and rich...I really enjoyed it and I have to admit, I felt relaxed and not wired:)"
"This is the best granola my family has ever had.  We cannot imagine eating another brand.  Not always easy to find in the store, since it is so popular, it is usually sold out.  Men's Health listed it as a favorite food recently.  Great in yogurt or with milk."
This tea and it's sister products from Numi give a whole new meaning to green tea.  The flavors are nuanced and sweet.  We drink a lot of it.
